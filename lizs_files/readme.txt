- Make sure to keep file name the same, if you change the pfp.png to something else lizspfp.png it won't match the file path anymore and won't work on my page

- You can use this repo too for if you do anything similar to what I'm doing (like a fake Myspace) and need like, for example a profile picture from me, and I can do the same thing etc, etc.

- But the main thing is to just keep the file name the same or change them as much as you want BEFORE I use the link, and the same applies to me if needed!!!
- That being said don't edit the name of pfp.png LOL i've already used the link.

- If you don't know how to get the github page link: go to the repo home page where it shows you the folders and everything, then on the right under "Deployments"
click "github-pages". Then it'll show you another page, click "https://etc etc"!! I'd opening the github page in a new tab and the repo explorer in another,
because to use the files as links in the github page you need to copy the file path at the top. So go back to the repo file explorer in another tab, and go
to the file. 

- It should look like this -->

- Click the ❒ (I couldn't find an actual copy symbol this is the closest I could get </3) and paste it at the end of the 'https://etc etc; link, then copy all of it!!
And you're done and can use that in your code and it'll work

- k bye
