- Make sure to keep file name the same, if you change the pfp.png to something else lizspfp.png it won't match the file path anymore and won't work on my page

- You can use this repo too for if you do anything similar to what I'm doing (like a fake Myspace) and need like, for example a profile picture from me, and I can do the same thing etc, etc.

- But the main thing is to just keep the file name the same or change them as much as you want BEFORE I use the link, and the same applies to me if needed!!!
